# morse-code
The program converts user input into Morse code.
One thing that I'd like to note here. I understand that hash table is not a perfect data structure for this simple program. An array would be sufficient. In fact, on Reddit many users showed me a simple and elegant solution without any hash table. I just wanted to manually implement hasha tables in C, that's why I seleected it. The point was neither efficiency nor speed nor anything else. I only wanted to practice.
